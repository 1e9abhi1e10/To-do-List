# To-do-List

In order to create a simple to-do list, we have to follow the following four steps:
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Step 1: Add HTML
   Line 1: We make a div that acts as a container for our to-do list.

  Lines 2–5: We make a div for the new task in which the user writes the name of the task, and at     the end, it has the “add” button.

  Line 6: We create a div for the written tasks.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Step 2: Add CSS
   Lines 1–22: We add the styling for the container.

   Lines 23–58: We add the styling for the tasks input field and the add “Task” button.

   Lines 59–94: We add the styling for the tasks which we have added.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Step 3: Add JavaScript
    Lines 1–4: We write a function that states that if a user doesn’t enter any task and presses      the “Add” button, then an alert message is generated which states that enter the task.

   Lines 6–16: If the user enters a task, then we have to decide what to do with the task. We use       the innerhtml to display all the information on the web page.

   Lines 18–23: We add a “Delete” button which can be found after every task.
NOW ADD HTML, CSS AND JS TOGETHER
